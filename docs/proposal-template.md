# Introduction

The project Online Bidding System is the software developed to simplify the communication process between the Seller and the Buyer. The software operators include the admin, the Seller, and the Buyers. The seller is responsible for selling a product in the site where other people can buy it based on their winning in the auction. This information is stored in the database along with their details. The admin can view Customer and Seller details and Auction details Auction winning report, Product details. When a person placed a bid on a particular product then he is eligible to place an order for the product when he wins the auction by the end of the date where auction closes. The system can thus reduce complexity in maintaining Bidding details and ease the process of Auction for a Product. The project is developed on ASP .Net platform and supported by a SQL database to store the user specific details.

# Method/Approach

We're going to use the Agile approach, which means we'll start by making a list of all the features we want to develop. First, we'll focus on designing the Database and making sure the ER model is all set. After that, we'll work on creating the Backend API.Along with that we'll be working on frontend and designing the website. 
Main activities for a web application development approach are:
1. System analysis: Understanding the requirements that     are necessary for developing the application
2.	Design: Designing the required modules
3.	Development: Developing the application to its    complete functionality
4.	Testing: Testing the application
5.	Deployment: Deploying the web application

# Estimated Timeline
- Login/Registration Module - 1st week
- Customer Module - 2nd week
- Product Module - 3rd week
- Report Module - 4th week
- Dashboard Module - 5th week

The project duration for collecting requirements and completing the mentioned modules is set at five weeks. This timeline provides a clear outline for the project schedule
  

# Anticipated Problems

-  Depending on the team's experience level, there may be varying levels of familiarity with .NET API Core. Ensuring that everyone is proficient in the technology can be a potential hurdle.
- Given the complexity of building an online bidding system, time management will be crucial. Balancing development, testing, and integration can be demanding.
- Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface requires thoughtful design. Ensuring that the website is accessible and easy to navigate can be a significant task.
